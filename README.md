## Introduction
Currently I work for a large financial institution, where managing loans is a critical component of business operations.To ensure informed decisions are made about loan approvals and risk is efficiently managed, I have been tasked with developing a comprehensive understanding of the loan portfolio data. My job is to perform exploratory data analysis on the loan portfolio, using various statistical and data visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the loan data. This information will enable the business to make more informed decisions about loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.

## Setting up conda environment
We set up the conda encironment, I am including instruction of how I do this, later we may want to clone the envirnomant, ```conda create -n loans_in_fin  python=3.10```, we activate our conda environment ```conda loans_in_fin```. Next we install packages we will need.

``` conda -c install pandas numpy```
